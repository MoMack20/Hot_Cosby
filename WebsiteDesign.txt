World Kingdom Ministries Website

- Informative website, not too much interactivity with users
- Warm color palette
- full length banner with title and background
- 60% to 70% width container for main content view
- roll out navigation from the left, clickable menu icon near top of page

Possible Ideas

- Full background image/pattern with data entries having their own semi transparent background
- Newspaperish format with different columns and rows
- (Recurring images) Crosses, bibles, fleur de lis, light beams
